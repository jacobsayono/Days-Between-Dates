# Days-Between-Dates
### An algorithmic set of functions used to find the number of days between two dates.

- Input:
    - integer parameters `year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2`
- Output:
    - integer `number of days`

This program takes into account `leap years` and the assumption that the `start date` input is before the `end date`.

If the `start date` is the same as the `end date`, the program returns 0 days.

#### This step-by-step process solves our problem using algorithmic thinking, a skill commonly used in developing programs.
